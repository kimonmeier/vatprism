### Question:

#### Where does VATprism get its data from?

### Answer:

Data is fetched from [the VATSIM API](https://api.vatsim.net/api/). Static data like FIR-Boundaries are updated on every
startup and are sourced from
the [VAT-Spy Client Data Update Project](https://github.com/vatsimnetwork/vatspy-data-project).

### Answer:

[This is most likely an issue with your Windows Fonts,](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66845136/3000387) more specifically
with a corrupted or missing Segoe UI font. To fix this issue, reinstall Segoe UI.

### Question:

#### Why is macOS telling me that VATprism is damaged and cannot be opened?

### Answer:

This is an issue with codesign and currently, there only exists a workaround that probably has to be executed after
every update.

1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to the Applications folder with the command `cd /Applicationns/`
3. Run codesign with the command `codesign --remove-signature VATprism.app`

Hopefully, I will be able to resolve this in the future so that workaround becomes unnecessary.

### Question:

#### [VATprism scaling behaviour is broken on high DPI screens](https://github.com/marvk/vatprism/issues/47)
